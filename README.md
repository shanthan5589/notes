# Computer Languages Notes Repository

Welcome to my **first repository**! This repo contains notes for the programming languages that Iâ€™m currently working on.

## ðŸ“š What's Inside

Right now, this repository includes notes and code snippets for:

- **Python** â€“ Brief intro, notes on String methods, few syntax tips which I have explored so far to make the code even better and shorter, will keep updating this repo as I learn new things.

> *Note: I havenâ€™t started on other languages yet, but I plan to add Java as I progress in my learning journey.*

Feel free to browse the folders to see detailed notes on Python. I hope these notes are helpful for others learning Python or anyone who wants a quick revision.
