Welcome to my **first repository**! This repo contains notes for the programming languages that Iâ€™m currently working on.

## ðŸ“š What's Inside

Right now, this repository includes notes and code snippets for:

- **Python** â€“ Brief intro, built-in methods for each data type, important keywords and topics, few syntax tips which I have explored so far to make the code even better and shorter, will keep updating this repo as I learn new things.

> *Note: This notes has been made keeping in mind that the reader is familiar with basic languages like C.

Feel free to browse the folders to see detailed notes on Python. I hope these notes are helpful for others learning Python or anyone who wants a quick revision.
