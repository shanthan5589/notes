# Computer Languages Notes Repository

Welcome to my **first repository**!! This repo contains notes for various programming languages that I am learning. It's a simple but growing collection that I plan to expand as I dive deeper into different technologies.

This repository currently includes notes and code snippets for the following languages:

- **Python**
- **Java**

Feel free to browse the folders for each language to see detailed notes.
